Have a hackathon coming up and am learning JavaScript plus refreshing on HTML & CSS. Most of the code from the JavaScript folder
comes from me following lessons from Bro Code on YouTube. I'm placing the lessons/projects I find most helpful here so I can quickly 
look back at it later for notes. 

Note: I highly recommend watching his videos if you're learning front-end or need a quick refresher.
